        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>An easy-to-make classic featuring tasty hamburger 'steaks' smothered 
            in gravy and onions. Traditionally served with hot white rice or potatoes, 
            it's a great way to dress up a pound of ground beef and you probably have 
            all the ingredients on hand!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound of ground beef</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp of ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp of seasoned salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp of onion powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp of garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp of Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup of thinly sliced onion</li>
            <li>2 tbsp of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup of beef broth</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of cooking sherry</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp of seasoned salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, egg, 
                bread crumbs, pepper, salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and 
                Worcestershire sauce.</li>
            <li>Form into 8 balls, and flatten into patties.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry the patties and onion 
                in the oil until patties are nicely browned, about 4 minutes per side. Remove 
                the beef patties to a plate, and keep warm.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle flour over the onions and drippings in the skillet. 
                Stir in flour with a fork, scraping bits of beef off of the bottom as you stir. 
                Gradually mix in the beef broth and sherry. Season with seasoned salt. Simmer and 
                stir over medium-low heat for about 5 minutes, until the gravy thickens. Turn heat to low, 
                return patties to the gravy, cover, and simmer for another 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
